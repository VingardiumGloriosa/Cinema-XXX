Section 1 - Samuel Bartek (GitHub usernames: DedicatedWorker4ever or TheSamuelBartek)

I mostly participated in:
- Setting up entetities, dtos, and repositories at the start of the project
- Foundation of #1-2(not actual search), Get for #3
- Setting up dataSetup, connecting entities and adjusting JSON return format
- Debugging api and going back to make sure points still worked after mergers and adjustments,
  which broke down
- Being Scrum master for first sprint

Special thanks to Chiara who picked up a lot of slack and helped me in many areas.

I mostly participated in:
- setting up the movies controller,

Section 3 - Patrik Selecky (GitHub username: MrBigRedButton)

I mostly participated in:
- setting up the CI/CD pipeline through jenkins
- setting up the db on aws ec2 instance
- partially point 4 of the first sprint and pont 5 of the second sprint

I would like to thank everyone that patiently answered my seemingly never ending questions!
Many thanks to everyone that helped with making my code actually run.

Section 4 - Chiara Visca (GitHub username: Chia - chia030)

I mostly participated in: 
- setting up the repository with a base layer that everyone could start from,
- backlog points #1, #2 and #5 from the first sprint,
- backlog point #4 and #7 from the second sprint.

These were my main focal points but none of my work was completed by myself alone! 
Our multiple daily meetings made it so anything we did was achieved through shared effort.
